# Concept: Feature Work Template

This page defines the reusable skeletons for starting a new feature with the
[[wiki/concept/llm_assisted_feature_workflow]].

Use this invocation:

```text
Start a new feature using the LLM-assisted feature workflow: <feature name>
```

The expected output is:

```text
wiki/work/<feature-slug>/
  brief.md                 (required)
  references.md            (optional)
  design.md                (optional)
  spike.md                 (optional)
  implementation_plan.md   (optional)
  dev_handoff.md           (optional)
  verification.md          (optional)
  index.md                 (optional; long-running research threads)
```

Only create the artifacts that are useful for the feature. For a small feature,
`brief.md` plus `verification.md` may be enough. For a high-uncertainty feature,
include `references.md`, `design.md`, and `spike.md` before implementation. Use
`dev_handoff.md` when the work will be handed to the Developer role in a
separate session. Use `index.md` when the folder is a long-running research
thread with dated snapshots rather than a bounded feature.

## Frontmatter For Work Artifacts

Every file under `wiki/work/` is a wiki page and must carry the standard
frontmatter from `AGENTS.md`. Use `type: concept` for work artifacts unless a
page is specifically a `decision` or `tension` (research-thread `index.md`
pages may use `type: workflow`). Start each artifact from this block, adjusting
`title`, `repo_scope`, `implementation_area`, `format_domain`, `tags`, and
`grounded_by` to fit the feature:

```yaml
---
title: "<Artifact>: <Feature Name>"
type: concept
confidence: medium
grounded_by: []
policy: agent-editable
last_validated: YYYY-MM-DD
repo_scope: pEyeON | pEyeON-Analytics | cross-repo
implementation_area: scanner | schema | dlt-pipeline | dbt-gold | streamlit | container | surfactant-plugins | analytics | dev-environment
format_domain: executable | firmware | archive | script | document | package | container-image | cross-domain | none
audience: llm-agent | developer | researcher | mixed
status: draft
source_paths: wiki/work/<feature-slug>/<artifact>.md
tags: [feature-work]
---
```

The body skeletons below assume this frontmatter is present.

## `brief.md`

```markdown
# Feature Brief: <Feature Name>

## Problem

## Goals

## Non-Goals

## User-Facing Behavior

## Acceptance Criteria

## Affected Areas

## References

## Open Questions

## Test Plan

## Done When
```

## `references.md`

```markdown
# Feature References: <Feature Name>

## Live Repo Sources

## External Sources

## Related Wiki Pages

## Libraries And APIs

## Notes
```

## `design.md`

```markdown
# Feature Design: <Feature Name>

## Summary

## Proposed Approach

## Data Model Or Schema Changes

## Interfaces And User Experience

## Edge Cases

## Error Handling

## Risks

## Alternatives Considered

## Open Questions
```

## `spike.md`

```markdown
# Feature Spike: <Feature Name>

## Question

## Hypothesis

## Experiment

## Prototype Location

## Results

## Recommendation

## Follow-Ups
```

## `implementation_plan.md`

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: <Feature Name>

## Scope

## Steps

## Files Likely To Change

## Tests To Add Or Update

## Migration Or Compatibility Notes

## Rollback Plan

## Done Checklist
```

## `dev_handoff.md`

The instruction document for the Developer role. It must carry the approval
header and be complete enough that the Developer needs no architectural
decisions (see `AGENTS.md` §Feature Work). The copy/paste prompt should
activate the Developer role and enumerate the exact context files to read.

```markdown
# Dev Handoff: <Feature Name>

**Status:** Draft | Approved
**Architect Approval:** Pending | Approved YYYY-MM-DD

## Copy/Paste Prompt

Use this prompt to hand the work to a Developer session:

    As the Developer, implement the feature: <feature-slug>.

    Use these wiki files as the handoff context:

    - wiki/work/<feature-slug>/brief.md
    - wiki/work/<feature-slug>/design.md
    - wiki/work/<feature-slug>/implementation_plan.md

    Goal: <one-sentence goal for this slice>.

    Before editing, read AGENTS.md and confirm this handoff is Approved.

## Handoff Summary

## Primary Sources For The Dev Agent

## Recommended First Implementation Slice

## Non-Goals For This Slice

## Testing Expectations

## Closeout Instructions

- Update wiki/work/<feature-slug>/verification.md with commands run and results.
- Update the wiki/work/<feature-slug>/implementation_plan.md done checklist.
- Append a concise entry to wiki/log.md.
- Promote durable facts into canonical wiki pages once behavior stabilizes.
```

## `verification.md`

The audit artifact for the Developer role. Record the exact commands and the
full output — do not summarize. Record every deviation from the handoff
explicitly; write `None` if there were none.

```markdown
# Verification: <Feature Name>

## Test Commands

## Manual Checks

## Results

[Full command/test output here — do not summarize]

## Deviations From Handoff

- None

## Known Gaps

## Follow-Ups
```

## `index.md` (research threads)

For long-running research threads that accumulate dated snapshots and handoffs
instead of a bounded feature lifecycle.

```markdown
# Research Thread: <Thread Name>

<One paragraph: what this thread tracks and why it is separate from
canonical pages until findings are validated.>

## Pages

- [[wiki/work/<thread-slug>/<page>]] <one-line description>

## Current Scope

## Open Research Questions

# Feature Metrics Template (Velocity)

Defines `wiki/work/<feature-slug>/metrics.md`, the per-feature Velocity
results file governed by
[[wiki/decision/2026-08-27-adopt-velocity-mini-lab]]. The metric itself is
defined in [[wiki/concept/velocity-metric]]. Read those pages for the
protocol and rationale; this page defines only the file format. Methodology
is never restated per feature — a rendered `metrics.md` links here and to the
ADR.

Field names and semantics are kept identical to the Wintap ecosystem's
template (`../Wintap-Analytics/wiki/concept/metrics-template.md`, v2.1 field
set) so results remain comparable and a future aggregation script can consume
both projects' files.

The human-readable section is titled **Results** and leads with:

- estimated delivery speed in multiples of one solo developer's pace;
- a plausible range written as "about `<lo>×–<hi>×` faster";
- a simple confidence label; and
- one direct sentence explaining that confidence.

The structured record stores **Feature Velocity** =
`solo_hours / (5.714 × lead_time_days)` and its canonical uncertainty field.
"Solo-hours" is the standing unit label. Attention remains a demoted,
coverage-annotated diagnostic.

## Lifecycle

1. **Exploration start (Engineer):** create `metrics.md` from the skeleton
   below and fill the `ai_est_*` fields plus `ai_est_basis` — **before**
   reading the interview's `## Sealed — human estimates` section. If the
   seal is already broken (this session saw the Architect's answers, e.g.
   because it ran the interview), leave the `ai_est_*` fields null.
2. **Handoff drafting (Engineer):** add one entry to `units:` per
   implementation slice or handoff unit with `est_hours` and `basis`, before
   that unit's implementation begins.
3. **Close-out (Engineer):** record `ts_available` and `availability_anchor`
   (dated artifact demonstrating the brief's frozen acceptance criteria —
   normally a `verification.md` entry — plus a one-line why); compute
   `lead_time_days`; copy the human estimates (unsealed) from
   `interview.md`; set `solo_hours` from the human sealed
   forced-counterfactual; compute `feature_velocity` (canonical formula, one
   decimal) and `velocity_uncertainty` (band implied by the two sealed
   solo-hours estimates, widened to the default ±2× until calibration
   narrows it); set `comparability` from the close-out question's answer
   (capability vs. willingness — see Field Definitions); fill per-unit
   `actual_hours` from verification records where derivable; record the
   attention diagnostic **only if** the main session supplied one (with its
   coverage annotation); write the plain-language Results block and the
   prose tabulation; **append the feature's row to [[wiki/metrics]]**.

Missing data at any stage is fine — never gate, never nag, never re-ask
(see the ADR's never-gates rule).

## Field Definitions (core metrics)

- `ts_open` — the feature's `opened` date: interview / design kickoff.
  Queue/backlog wait before this is deliberately invisible.
- `ts_available` — date of the **first Architect-accepted validation event
  satisfying the feature brief's acceptance criteria as frozen at open**,
  evidenced by a dated artifact (a `verification.md` entry). Availability is
  final: post-acceptance defects never move it (ADR guardrail 2).
- `availability_anchor` — pointer to that dated artifact plus a one-line
  note on why it was chosen as the acceptance evidence.
- `criteria_amendments` — logged mid-feature acceptance-criteria changes, if
  any (ADR guardrail 1); empty list when none.
- `lead_time_days` — raw calendar days from `ts_open` to `ts_available`,
  **weekends and away-time included** (see the ADR for the normative
  rationale).
- `solo_hours` — the human sealed forced-counterfactual estimate, in hours.
  The Velocity numerator and the feature's portfolio weight.
- `feature_velocity` — `solo_hours / (5.714 × lead_time_days)`, reported to
  **one decimal**. 5.714 is the declared one-FTE capacity baseline (40
  h/week ÷ 7 days); never recomputed.
- `velocity_uncertainty` — the uncertainty range that travels with
  `feature_velocity`: the band implied by the two independently sealed
  solo-hours estimates (human + Engineer), widened to a default ±2× until
  calibration data narrows it. E.g. `"2-7"` for a 3.5 point value. In the
  Results section, render this as **"Plausible range: about 2×–7× faster,"**
  not the shorthand "uncertainty 2–7."
- **Results confidence** — a human-readable label, not an additional YAML
  metric. Apply it consistently:
  - **Low:** either estimate is retrospective, unsealed, anchored, missing,
    or otherwise not an independent pair.
  - **Medium:** both estimates were independently sealed, but the plausible
    range still uses the default ±2× because calibration is limited.
  - **High:** both estimates were independently sealed and accumulated
    calibration evidence justifies a narrower range.
  State the reason in one sentence; never imply statistical confidence.
- `comparability` — `none` | `willingness-only` | `capability-exceeded`,
  derived from the close-out question. `capability-exceeded` (scope beyond
  what the developer could have built solo) flags the feature out of the
  fitted trend as an annotated point; `willingness-only` (would not have
  attempted, but could have) does **not** exclude it.

## Parseability Contract

All metric values live in the single fenced yaml block in the body, with the
stable field names below — one value per field, no values buried in prose —
so a future aggregation script can consume every feature's `metrics.md`
without scraping text. Do not rename fields; add new ones only via a
revision to this template and the ADR. Unknown values are `null`, never
omitted, never prose like "TBD". Hours are decimal numbers; dates are ISO
8601.

## Skeleton

Standard work-artifact frontmatter first (see
[[wiki/concept/feature_work_template]]), then:

````markdown
# Feature Metrics: <Feature Name>

Velocity results governed by
[[wiki/decision/2026-08-27-adopt-velocity-mini-lab]];
metric definition in [[wiki/concept/velocity-metric]].
SEAL NOTE: `interview.md` `## Sealed — human estimates` must not be read by
the estimating agent until close-out.

## Results

<Filled at close-out — the short human-readable block; every number repeats
in the YAML below.>

- **Estimated delivery speed:** **<n.n>× one solo developer's pace**
- **Plausible range:** **about <lo>×–<hi>× faster**
- **Estimate confidence:** **<High | Medium | Low>**
- **Why confidence is <label>:** <One direct sentence.>
- **Delivered in:** **<n> calendar days** (<ts_open> → <ts_available>)
- **Estimated solo effort:** **<n> hours**

<One short paragraph stating what acceptance evidence closed the feature and
whether the capability-vs-willingness answer keeps it comparable.>

## Technical Record

cross-feature rollup.

## Close-Out Tabulation

<Filled at close-out: small estimates-vs-actuals table (human vs. AI vs.
measured availability dates and solo-hours), followed by the calculation in
plain language: "estimated <n.n>× one solo developer's pace; plausible range
about <lo>×–<hi>×." Explain limitations directly. Prose goes here; every
number must also exist in the YAML block above. Then append the feature's
row to [[wiki/metrics]].>
